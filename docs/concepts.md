# Security Concepts

## Identity

Principals are entities having identity, e.g. a human (you) or a computer server, or a program.


## Encryption




## Public-key cryptography

[Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)...

One of the oldest such systems is called _RSA._ It is based on two large prime numbers:

1. ...

RSA is not the only public-key cryptography system. Another one is e.g.
[Elliptic-curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) (ECC).


## Keys



## Signatures

_[Signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature)_ an input with a private key produces a _signature_ which can be _verified_ against the same input given a public key.

Input to signing is typically be limited in size.  Therefore a digest (hash) of an input file is used.


## Trust

## Chains


## X.509
