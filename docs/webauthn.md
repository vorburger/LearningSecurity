 # WebAuthn
 
 https://webauthn.guide gives a good (technical) introduction, and
 https://webauthn.io a neat demo, of the Web standard defined on
 https://w3c.github.io/webauthn.
 (https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/ has more detailed longer information.)
 
 It works well in current versions of desktop browsers, and on mobile on Chrome on Android.
 
 There is currently no easy way in the FOSS community to use U2F in an android browser
 ([see here](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/7756), but 
 [note this](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/4286)).
 
 [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) is an unrelated standard.
