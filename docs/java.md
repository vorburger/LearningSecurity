# Java Security

## ToDo

1. Basic Java Security, mapping the [Concepts](concepts.md), with some wording inspired by Tink already

1. https://github.com/google/tink, like https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/JAVA-HOWTO.md

1. NB: Consider https://github.com/google/conscrypt due to: _If youâ€™re developing on this code you will need Oracle JDK in order to run the tests. The reason why is because we test strong cryptography algorithms such as Elliptic Curve and these are not available by default with OpenJDK itself._ (from https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-auth/tree/master/vertx-auth-jwt)
