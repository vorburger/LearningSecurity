1. **README linked pages missing content**

1. How to encrypt something so that 2 private keys can decrypt it?
   See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/597188/encryption-decryption-with-multiple-keys,
   and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?

1. Generate private key on a YubiKey using PIV, see https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/.
   This is traditionally for non-web applications (although it should be possible to use for client certs, no?),
   and WebAuthn is the modern way to go instead.
